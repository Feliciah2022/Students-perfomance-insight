# Students-perfomance-insight

This project analyzes student performance data using Python, data visualization tools, and Looker Studio.
The goal is to uncover insights related to students’ math, reading, and writing scores while exploring how gender, ethnicity, parental education, lunch type, and test preparation affect overall performance.

 Project Overview
The Students Performance Dashboard provides a visual and interactive way to understand student outcomes.

It includes:
Overall dataset statistics

Performance comparisons by demographic groups
Subject-wise distribution
Pass/Fail segmentation
Impact of test preparation courses
Average scores by category
The dashboard was built to simplify large datasets into clear insights for educators, researchers, and decision-makers.

 Data Processing Workflow
1️ Data Collection
Data sourced from a public dataset containing 1,000 student records.

2️ Data Cleaning
Handled missing values
Standardized column names
Formatted numeric values

3️ Data Integration & Analysis
Computed average scores
Created grouped metrics based on gender, ethnicity, lunch type, and test prep
Generated pass/fail categories

4️ Visualization & Reporting
Developed Looker Studio dashboard
Created PowerPoint visual report

 Key Insights
 Overall Performance
Average Score: ~67.4
Writing scores show the lowest performance compared to math and reading.
 Gender Comparison
Females generally perform slightly better across subjects.
 Ethnicity Groups
Score variations exist across ethnic groups, with Groups D and E performing the highest.
 Test Preparation Course

Students who completed the test preparation course scored significantly higher:
Completed: ~72.35
None: ~64.71

 Pass/Fail Ratio

Pass rate is approximately 70%
